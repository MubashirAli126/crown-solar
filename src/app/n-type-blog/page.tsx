                            <p className='my-3 text-base font-semibold text-left'>Pakistan&apos;s Rising Solar Energy Landscape</p>
                            <p className='mt-3 pb-2 text-bas font-medium text-left'>Like numerous other nations, Pakistan is devoted to declining its carbon footprint and making certain that energy is produced sustainably in the future. Solar energy has shown to be an advantageous answer in this endeavor. Due to the nation&apos;s plentiful daylight aids and rising demands for power, solar power is evolving into a more pretty choice for both industrial and family uses.</p>
                            <p className='pb-2 text-base font-medium text-left'>But it&apos;s crucial to use solar energy effectively. Traditional solar panels have been the norm for centuries, frequently penned of P-type silicon. The arrival of N-type tech has the potential to entirely alter the solar energy environment, even though these panels have surely helped Pakistan&apos;s solar energy enterprise flourish.</p>
                            <p className='mt-3 pb-2 text-base font-semibold text-left'>What exactly are N-type solar panels?</p>
                            <p className='pb-2 text-base font-medium text-left'>N-type solar panels are a new species of photovoltaic cells planned to improve energy conversion. Rather than the P-type silicon used in conventional solar panels, they comprise N-type silicon, another type of silicon material.</p>
                            <p className='pb-2 text-base font-medium text-left'>The absence of boron, normally found in P-type silicon, is the primary distinction between N-type and P-type technology. The ensuing benefits of this distinction make N-type solar panels a desirable choice for the solar power epoch:</p>

                            <ol>
                                <li className='pb-2 text-base font-medium text-left'><strong>1. More wonderful Efficiency: </strong>  Because N-type solar panels are more responsive to longer light wavelengths and have less receptivity to contaminants, they have a higher photoelectric modification efficiency. Extra power can be produced from the same surface area as a result of this.</li>
                                <li className='pb-2 text-base font-medium text-left'><strong>2. Expanded Durability: </strong> N-type panels last a lot longer than P-type panels do. This signifies that they are less predisposed to need to be replaced over the years, earning them an affordable option.</li>
                                <li className='pb-2 text-base font-medium text-left'><strong>3. Enhanced Performance at High Temperatures: </strong>  N-type panels serve well under the country&apos;s harsh summer heat. Transistors ensure a steady energy output since they are less powerless to high-temperature efficiency reductions.</li>
                                <li className='pb-2 text-base font-medium text-left'><strong>4. Relieved Degradation Rate: </strong>  N-type solar panels supplied a more steady and dependable energy seed over decades due to their slower degradation rates.</li>
                                <li className='pb-2 text-bas font-medium text-left'><strong>5. Tiniest Light-Induced Degradation: </strong> One of the most common problems with solar panels is Light-Induced Degradation (LID). Since N-type panels are less likely to have LID, their performance will remain steady.</li>
                            </ol>
